def function(arg1, arg2):
    """A simple function of two arguments.

    This function takes two arguments, but does absolutely nothing with them.
    However, it sends out a friendly greeting to the world.

    Args:
        arg1:  The first argument
        arg2:  The second argument

    Returns:
        A string stating "Hello World"

    Examples:
        >>> function(1, 2)
        "Hello World"
        >>> function('a', 'b')
        "Hello World"

    Intent:
        The intent is to demonstrate sections like this one within docstrings.
        How they behave with multiple lines.

        And how they behave with multiple paragraphs.
        That contain multiple lines.

    Paragraphs stading by themselves without indention, should be left alone.
