## @brief     Generates a single block of a maze.

#    This simple generator randomly picks a character from a list (the two
#    diagonal lines by default) and returns it on each iteration.
#
#
# @param		blockOptions	The list of characters to choose from.
#
# @return
#        A single character chosen from blockOptions.
